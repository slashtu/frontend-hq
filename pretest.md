## Description:

There is a campaign with 10 streamers. The competition is very intense. Scores of every streamer updated every second. Please make a leaderboard for live update and keep updating data randomly ([Math.random](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) is okay) to let us observe your work.

## Requirement:

- Use [React](https://reactjs.org) for rendering and [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com) for style management. Others libraries are forbidden. Additional, building with functional component and hooks API are encouraged, so as TypeScript.
- Starter-kit like [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is allowed and actually encouraged, we don't want to waste any of your precious time setting up environment.
- Make sure following check points:
  - Score update animation (transition of value between original score and final score)
  - Order rearrange animation (transition of position between original position and final position).
- Any kind of implementation is acceptable.
- Be aware of animation trembling and consistency. We care about smooth animation.
- It will be impressive if there is any additional animation or visual effect presented.
- Make sure your app runs in the last 2 versions of Chrome.
- Keep your source code clean, organized and modularized, we will review them.
- We will also review your component and layout design, and keep speculating your intention from your code.
- Testing are bonus and are not required.
- Upload your app to (Or just code entirely on) [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) when done, make sure your app behaves normally in the preview too. Alternatively if your app for some reason cannot run on it, you can push your app to [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/). Please make sure to set up permission setting to let us view your project.
- Send us back an email along with the link of your application via reply. Once you've submitted the code, please don't update it afterwards. If for some reason the app breaks because of it, we won't be able to identify the cause.
